    <h3>girls who code projects</h3>
    <h4><i>octorescue</i></h4>
    <p><i><b>octorescue</b></i> is a simple scratch game. it is a sidescroller game, like games like flappy bird and geometry dash, 
    just better. players have called it <q>fun and addictive</q> and a <q>great game for all ages</q>. although it is simple in code 
    and has not been fully completed, the game is still in the works and will likely be completed. visit <a href="https://goo.gl/QhtwUs"
