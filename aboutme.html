		<p> hi! i'm amanda, a girl who codes. i am fifteen years old and a rising junior at livingston senior high school in new jersey. </p>
		<h3>things i like</h3>
		<p>i like the little things: kids that wave back to me, words like serendipity and acquaintance, the smell of grass, the sound of rain on glass, helping other people, and learning. </p>
		<h3>things i don't really like</h3>
		<p>there really isn't anything i don't like. i don't like people that are mean to others for no reason at all. that's it. </p>
		<p style="bold"> fun fact about me; i just turned fifteen a few weeks ago (so it looks like there's an entire year before i can get a learner's permit...). <br> another fun fact; i have a <a href = "https://sweetandtarteblog.wordpress.com/"> blog</a>!</p>
