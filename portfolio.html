this picture was taken at presque isle state park, a beautiful place just to spend time with the best people. for me, that is my
	family and close friends. i haven't really gotten the chance to spend time with my friends in the past few weeks because 
	of the end of the school year. i can't wait to go back to school just to be with them for another year. <br> the few
	people that had helped me get through the hardest of times bring joy to my heart the moment they smile. a genuine smile 
	from them means the world to me. honestly, i would give my life for them. they are the best thing that ever happened to me.
	<br> i have found that the people you spend the most time with mean the most to you. the people that i spend so much time with,
	my swim team, have grown closer than family. though i regret that i am spending less and less time with the people that are my
	biological family, my swim family means more than the world to me. they are always there for me, especially when the 
	problems in my life are the people that i need to have in my life. with them, i can always be myself and i can fall in love 
	with the kind of people that match my personality.
